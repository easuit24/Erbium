% Notes for research 

% Plot the rate constant for a fixed depth as a function of magnetic field
    % find a magnetic field where there are not any resonances and find
    % where the derivative is the smallest - this would be resting and
    % without resonances so we can see the ratio characteristics without
    % peaks 
    
    
    
 % restingbackground.m has the information for varying the magnetic field 
 
 
 % apply the analysis for the Born Oppenheimer potential by incorporating
 % contributions from C12, C6 and C6 and then integrating over... check to
 % make sure that the integrand is correct from Wiki 
 
 
 % Observations: weird how when I plot it as a function of magnetic field,
 % the ratio hangs around 2, 7 isn't even on the chart.... Currently
 % plotting from the original file to compare... Let's see 
 % ALSO find the average from the original plot... what really is the
 %average: ~5 total including resonances, but this is for a specific
 %magnetic field strength and varying mean depth. there could be a
 %different profile for the other plot where I just vary the magnetic
 %field. These plots are consistent with each other.
